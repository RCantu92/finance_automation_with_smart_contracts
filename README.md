# Smart Contract Automation: Automating Company Finances through Smart Contracts with Solidity

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/5040/1*xc4XWLHRlOSuroGSqgVX-g.jpeg)

The three smart contracts in place are as follows:

- Associate Profit Splitter
- Tiered Profit Splitter
- Defferred Equity Plan

Each of the listed smart contract's functions are below.

## Associate Profit Splitter

This contract will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. The main advantage this will have is to pay out to the employees quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, this contract was deployed on a local blockchain, and unable to be searched on a block explorer.

## Tiered Profit Splitter

This contract will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees according to their respective tiers/levels. For example, 60%, 25%, 15% as percentage thresholds, depending on their tiers/levels. Similar to the Associate Profit Splitter contract, this one is also on a local blockchain, and thus inaccessible.

## Defferred Equity Plan

This last contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for the selected employee. This contract was deployed on the Ropsten testnet with an address of 0x27f1dD67C5E34E84bF282AEBd4e2c74E3aD20253.
