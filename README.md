The three smart contracts in place are as follows:

- Associate Profit Splitter
- Tiered Profit Splitter
- Defferred Equity Plan

Each of the listed smart contract's functions are below.

## Associate Profit Splitter

This contract will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. The main advantage this will have is to pay out to the employees quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, this contract was deployed on a local blockchain, and unable to be searched on a block explorer.

## Tiered Profit Splitter

This contract will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees according to their respective tiers/levels. For example, 60%, 25%, 15% as percentage thresholds, depending on their tiers/levels. Similar to the Associate Profit Splitter contract, this one is also on a local blockchain, and thus inaccessible.

## Defferred Equity Plan

This last contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for the selected employee. This contract was deployed on the Kovan testnet with an address of 0xD093F2830c2360a5f5D025C7674CdaFd53719c43.

# Finance Automation: Automating Company Finances through Smart Contracts with Solidity

This project aims to provide a way to automate a company's finances via Solidity smart contracts.  There are three smart contracts that each would automate finances in three distinct scenarios.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
